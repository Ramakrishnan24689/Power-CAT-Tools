# AI automated documentation

The AI Automated Documentation Generation Tool is designed to streamline the creation of comprehensive solution documentation by leveraging AI-driven analysis. Users can either select a solution from their Power Platform environment or upload a solution file. The tool processes the input and generates a detailed Word document with insights and documentation for the solution.

Key Features

Solution Selection or Upload

The tool provides flexibility for users to either:

Select a Solution: Directly choose a solution from the Power Platform environment for automated documentation.

Upload a Solution: Upload a solution file (e.g., a .zip file) for offline documentation generation.

Automated Documentation Generation

AI-Driven Analysis: The tool automatically scans the solution components, including apps, flows, tables, and connections.

Comprehensive Output: Generates a structured Word document with detailed sections on solution architecture, component details, and best practices.

Customizable Documentation Template

Users can define custom templates to tailor the documentation format and include or exclude specific sections based on project requirements.
